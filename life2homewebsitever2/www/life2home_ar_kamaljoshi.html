						<h3 class="id-color">Ar. Kamal Joshi</h3>
						I, Kamal Joshi, hail from a middle-class family in Pune, Maharashtra, with roots in Uttarakhand. Despite initial resistance from my father, I followed my passion for architecture and graduated from MarathwadaMitra Mandal College of Architecture in 2004. This journey led me to become a registered Architect and ultimately, one half of KAMS DESIGNER ZONE.
						<br/><br/>
						<p>
							<b>Choosing the Path of Interior Design</b><br>After completing my BArch, I gained valuable experience in architecture. However, I realized that working on architectural projects often led to challenges in securing approvals and timely completions. This led us to shift our focus solely to interior design.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Education and Recommendations</b><br>I completed my architectural degree at MarathwadaMitra Mandal College of Architecture, Pune. While education is important, practical experience plays a significant role in this field.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Embracing Design Trends</b><br>We believe in adopting a maximalist approach to design, ensuring that our work remains relevant for years. Pastel shades with wooden accents can create timeless interiors.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Finding Inspiration</b><br>Our inspiration often comes from our clients' ideas. Understanding their needs and translating their imaginations into designs is our primary focus.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Challenges in the Field</b><br>Execution is a major challenge, ensuring projects are completed as per design, within budget, and on time. Maintaining relationships with vendors and clients is also essential.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Favorite Books</b><br>"Rich Dad Poor Dad" has been an inspiration for me, guiding my life and business principles.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Sources of Inspiration</b><br>My family and interactions with vendors and designers inspire me to keep innovating.
